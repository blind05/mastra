# Thread Title Generation Default Change

## Overview

Starting from version 0.21.2-alpha.0, the default value for `threads.generateTitle` has changed from `true` to `false`. This means thread title auto-generation is now opt-in rather than automatic.

## Why This Change?

This change was made to:
- Avoid unexpected LLM API calls and associated costs
- Give developers explicit control over when title generation occurs
- Improve predictability of memory behavior

## Migration Steps

### If You Want to Keep Auto-Generation

If your application relies on automatic thread title generation, you need to explicitly enable it in your memory configuration:

```typescript
// Before (implicit true)
const agent = new Agent({
  memory: new Memory({
    // generateTitle was true by default
  })
});

// After (explicit true)
const agent = new Agent({
  memory: new Memory({
    threads: {
      generateTitle: true  // Explicitly enable title generation
    }
  })
});
```

### Custom Title Generation

You can also customize the model and instructions used for title generation:

```typescript
const agent = new Agent({
  memory: new Memory({
    threads: {
      generateTitle: {
        model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
        instructions: "Generate a concise title (max 5 words) that summarizes the conversation"
      }
    }
  })
});
```
