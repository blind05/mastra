# Upgrade to Mastra v1

In this guide you'll learn how to upgrade through breaking changes in pre-v1 versions of Mastra. It'll also help you upgrade to Mastra v1.

Use your package manager to update your project's versions. Be sure to update **all** Mastra packages at the same time.

<Callout type="info">

Versions mentioned in the headings refer to the `@mastra/core` package. If necessary, versions of other Mastra packages are called out in the detailed description.

All Mastra packages have a peer dependency on `@mastra/core` so your package manager can inform you about compatibility.

## Migrate to v0.23 (unreleased)

<Callout>

This version isn't released yet but we're adding changes as we make them.

</Callout>

### Changed: Thread Title Generation Default

The default value for `threads.generateTitle` has changed from `true` to `false`. Thread title auto-generation is now opt-in rather than automatic.

**Why this change?**
- Avoid unexpected LLM API calls and associated costs
- Give developers explicit control over when title generation occurs
- Improve predictability of memory behavior

**Migration:**

If your application relies on automatic thread title generation, explicitly enable it in your memory configuration:

```typescript
// Before (implicit true)
const agent = new Agent({
  memory: new Memory({
    // generateTitle was true by default
  })
});

// After (explicit true)
const agent = new Agent({
  memory: new Memory({
    threads: {
      generateTitle: true  // Explicitly enable title generation
    }
  })
});
```

You can also customize the model and instructions used for title generation:

```typescript
const agent = new Agent({
  memory: new Memory({
    threads: {
      generateTitle: {
        model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
        instructions: "Generate a concise title (max 5 words) that summarizes the conversation"
      }
    }
  })
});
```

## Migrate to v0.22

### Deprecated: `format: "aisdk"`

The `format: "aisdk"` option in `stream()`/`generate()` methods is deprecated. Use the `@mastra/ai-sdk` package instead. Learn more in the [Using Vercel AI SDK documentation](../../docs/frameworks/agentic-uis/ai-sdk.mdx).

### Removed: MCP Classes

`@mastra/mcp` - `0.14.0`

- Removed `MastraMCPClient` class. Use [`MCPClient`](../../reference/tools/mcp-client.mdx) class instead.
- Removed `MCPConfigurationOptions` type. Use [`MCPClientOptions`](../../reference/tools/mcp-client.mdx#mcpclientoptions) type instead. The API is identical.
- Removed `MCPConfiguration` class. Use [`MCPClient`](../../reference/tools/mcp-client.mdx) class instead.

### Removed: CLI flags & commands

`mastra` - `0.17.0`

- Removed the `mastra deploy` CLI command. Use the deploy instructions of your individual platform.
- Removed `--env` flag from `mastra build` command. To start the build output with a custom env use `mastra start --env <env>` instead.
- Remove `--port` flag from `mastra dev`. Use `server.port` on the `new Mastra()` class instead.
