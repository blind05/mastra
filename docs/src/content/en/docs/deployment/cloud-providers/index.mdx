# Cloud Providers

Standalone Mastra applications can be deployed to many popular cloud providers including:

- [Digital Ocean](/docs/deployment/cloud-providers/digital-ocean)

## LibSQLStore

`LibSQLStore` writes to the local filesystem, which is not supported by some cloud providers due to their ephemeral nature. If you're deploying to a platform like Digital Ocean's App Platform, you **must remove** all usage of `LibSQLStore`.

Specifically, ensure you've removed it from both `src/mastra/index.ts` and `src/mastra/agents/weather-agent.ts`:


```diff filename="src/mastra/index.ts" showLineNumbers
export const mastra = new Mastra({
  // ...
-  storage: new LibSQLStore({
-    // stores telemetry, evals, ... into memory storage, if it needs to persist, change to file:../mastra.db
-    url: ":memory:",
-  })
});
```

``` diff filename="src/mastra/agents/weather-agent.ts" showLineNumbers
export const weatherAgent = new Agent({
  // ..
-  memory: new Memory({
-    storage: new LibSQLStore({
-      url: "file:../mastra.db" // path is relative to the .mastra/output directory
-    })
-  })
});
