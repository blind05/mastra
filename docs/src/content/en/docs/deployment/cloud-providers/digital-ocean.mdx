# Digital Ocean

Deploy standalone Mastra application to Digital Ocean's Droplets or App Platform.

## App Platform Prerequisites

- A Git repository containing your Mastra application
- A Digital Ocean account

## Deployment steps App Platform

Deploy your Mastra application to Digital Ocean's App Platform.
This guide will cover setting up an App Platform service for your Mastra application.

<Steps>

### Create a new App

- Log in to your Digital Ocean dashboard
- Navigate to the App Platform service
- Select your source provider and create a new app

### Configure deployment source

- Connect and select your repository. You may also choose a container image or a sample app
- Select the branch you want to deploy from
- Configure the source directory if necessary. If your Mastra application uses the default directory structure, no action is required here

### Configure resource settings and environment variables

- A Node.js build should be detected automatically
- Add any required environment variables for your Mastra application. This includes API keys, database URLs, and other configuration values
- You may choose to configure the size of your resource here
- Other things you may optionally configure include, the region of your resource, the unique app name, and what project the resource belongs to
- Once you're done, you may create the app after reviewing your configuration and pricing estimates

</Steps>

Your app will be built and deployed automatically, and DigitalOcean will provide a URL to access it
