# Fixes Applied

## 1. Content is not defined error
Fixed variable scoping issue in `createWorkflow` method where `content` was defined inside if-else blocks but used outside.

## 2. MCP Docs Server Package Name
Fixed the incorrect package name from `@mastra/mcp-server` to `@mastra/mcp-docs-server` and removed the unnecessary URL parameter.

## 3. Added Comprehensive Tests
- Created test suite using Vitest
- Added tests for GitHub issue fetching, project creation, MCP configuration
- All 8 tests passing

## 4. Updated Documentation
- Added test instructions to README
- Documented the correct MCP docs server package name
- Added details about available tools from the docs server

The debug command should now work properly with both filesystem and documentation access through MCP servers.
