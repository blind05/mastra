# CI Optimization Summary - Start Here!

## 🎯 What's Wrong With Your CI?

Your CI is **35-45 minutes per PR** and it should be **10-15 minutes**.

### The Main Problems:

1. **Sequential Workflow Chaining** - Using `workflow_run` adds 2-3 min delay
2. **Redundant Work** - Each workflow rebuilds the same packages
3. **Inefficient E2E Tests** - Building entire monorepo when only need 2-3 packages
4. **Cache Misconfiguration** - Most workflows set to read-only Turbo cache
5. **No Build Artifact Sharing** - Every test rebuilds from scratch

## 🚀 What Should I Do First?

### Recommended: Start with Quick Wins

```bash
# 1. Read the quick wins guide
cat CI_QUICK_WINS.md

# 2. Create a branch
git checkout -b ci-optimization-quick-wins

# 3. Apply Quick Win #1 (most impactful)
find .github/workflows -name "secrets.*.yml" -type f -exec sed -i '' 's/TURBO_CACHE: remote:r$/TURBO_CACHE: remote:rw/g' {} \;

# 4. Manually apply Quick Wins #2-6 (see CI_QUICK_WINS.md)

# 5. Test on a PR
git add .github/workflows/
git commit -m "ci: apply quick win optimizations"
git push origin ci-optimization-quick-wins

# 6. Measure the results!
```

**Expected results after Quick Wins:**

- Current: 35-45 minutes
- After: 25-32 minutes
- **Savings: 8-14 minutes (30% faster)**

## 📊 Decision Matrix

| If you have...      | Then do...                             | Expected result                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 30 minutes now      | Quick Wins only                        | 30% faster (~25-32 min)          |
| 1 day this week     | Quick Wins → measure → decide          | 30% faster, data for phase 2     |
| 1 week to invest    | Full refactor (all phases)             | 50-65% faster (~10-15 min)       |
| CI is blocking work | Quick Wins TODAY, refactor next sprint | Immediate relief + long-term fix |

## 🎯 Quick Wins Checklist

Use this to track your progress:

- [ ] **Quick Win #1: Turbo cache** (5 min)
  - Change `TURBO_CACHE: remote:r` → `remote:rw` in all test workflows
  - Impact: 2-5 min savings

- [ ] **Quick Win #2: E2E builds** (10 min)
  - Update e2e-deployers to only build deployer packages
  - Update e2e-kitchen-sink to only build required packages
  - Impact: 5-8 min savings

- [ ] **Quick Win #3: Shallow clones** (5 min)
  - Add `fetch-depth: 1` to most checkout steps
  - Impact: 30-60 sec savings

- [ ] **Quick Win #4: Timeouts** (5 min)
  - Add `timeout-minutes: 15` to test jobs
  - Add `timeout-minutes: 20` to E2E jobs
  - Impact: Prevents hanging jobs

- [ ] **Quick Win #5: pnpm setup** (5 min, optional)
  - Use official `pnpm/action-setup@v4` action
  - Impact: Cleaner config

- [ ] **Quick Win #6: Matrix parallelism** (2 min)
  - Add `max-parallel: 5` to store test matrix
  - Impact: Consistency

## 📈 Measuring Success

### Before making changes:

```bash
# Check recent PR CI durations
gh run list --workflow="Quality assurance" --limit 5
gh run list --workflow="Core Package Tests" --limit 5
```

### After making changes:

1. Create a test PR with quick wins
2. Watch the workflow runs
3. Compare durations with previous runs
4. Look for:
   - Faster build steps (cache hits)
   - Faster E2E tests
   - No failures

### Success criteria:

- ✅ All tests still pass
- ✅ Total duration reduced by 20-30%
- ✅ No new flaky tests
- ✅ Turbo cache showing hits in logs

## 🔄 Migration Path

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (This Week)

```
Day 1: Implement Quick Wins
Day 2-7: Monitor & measure
```

**Goal:** 30% faster, confidence in changes

### Phase 2: Full Refactor (Next Sprint, Optional)

```
Week 1: Implement consolidated workflow
Week 2: Test in parallel with old workflow
Week 3: Switch over & remove old workflows
```

**Goal:** 50-65% faster

### Phase 3: Fine-Tuning (Ongoing)

```
Monitor cache hit rates
Optimize slow tests
Adjust timeouts
Consider self-hosted runners
```

**Goal:** Continuous improvement

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Cache isn't working"

- Verify `TURBO_TOKEN` and `TURBO_TEAM` secrets are set
- Check Turbo logs for cache hit/miss
- Ensure `turbo.json` outputs are correct

### "E2E tests failing after targeted builds"

- Verify the filter pattern includes all dependencies
- Check if any implicit dependencies were missed
- May need to add packages to filter

### "Tests are flaky after changes"

- Quick wins shouldn't cause flakiness
- If you see new failures, they were probably already there
- Check if timeouts are too aggressive

### "No speed improvement"

- Turbo cache takes 1-2 runs to warm up
- Check if you're comparing cold vs warm cache
- Verify changes were actually applied (check workflow files)

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start Small**: Just do Quick Win #1 first, see results, then do more

2. **Measure Everything**: Take screenshots of CI times before/after

3. **Communicate**: Let team know you're optimizing CI so they don't worry about changes

4. **Test Thoroughly**: Make sure all tests still pass after changes

5. **Iterate**: You don't have to do everything at once
