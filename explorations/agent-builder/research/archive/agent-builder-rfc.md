# RFC: Mastra Agent Builder

**RFC Number**: 001  
**Title**: Mastra Agent Builder - A Meta-Agent for Creating Mastra Agents  
**Author(s)**: Mastra Team  
**Status**: Draft  
**Created**: 2025-01-10  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-10  

## 1. Executive Summary

This RFC proposes the development of a Mastra Agent Builder - a specialized meta-agent that can create other Mastra agents through natural language conversation. The Agent Builder will leverage Mastra's existing infrastructure, integrate with the MCP documentation server, and implement patterns learned from successful coding agents like v0, Lovable, and Cursor.

### Key Features
- Natural language agent specification
- Template-based code generation with validation
- Progressive enhancement through conversation
- Integration with Mastra docs via MCP
- Learning from successful patterns

### Expected Outcomes
- Reduce agent creation time from hours to minutes
- Lower barrier to entry for Mastra adoption
- Establish patterns for best practices
- Enable non-developers to create functional agents

## 2. Motivation

### Current Challenges
1. **Steep Learning Curve**: Creating Mastra agents requires understanding multiple concepts (tools, workflows, memory, etc.)
2. **Boilerplate Code**: Significant repetitive code for basic agent setup
3. **Integration Complexity**: Connecting various Mastra features requires deep knowledge
4. **Pattern Discovery**: Users must discover best practices through trial and error

### Opportunity
The maturity of LLM tooling and Mastra's modular architecture creates an opportunity to build an intelligent agent creation system that:
- Guides users through agent design
- Generates validated, production-ready code
- Teaches best practices through examples
- Evolves based on usage patterns

## 3. Proposed Solution

### 3.1 Core Concept

A pre-configured Mastra Agent with specialized tools for:
1. **Requirements Analysis**: Understanding user needs
2. **Pattern Matching**: Finding similar existing agents
3. **Code Generation**: Creating agent configurations and tools
4. **Validation**: Ensuring generated code works correctly
5. **Iteration**: Refining based on feedback

### 3.2 Architecture Overview

```
User → Agent Builder → Analysis → Pattern Matching → Code Generation
                          ↓                               ↓
                     Documentation                    Validation
                         (MCP)                            ↓
                                                     Deployment
```

    1. Understanding their requirements
    2. Suggesting appropriate architectures
    3. Generating working code
    4. Iterating based on feedback`,
  model: dynamicModelSelection, // GPT-4o for planning, 4o-mini for code
  tools: {
    configSnippetBuilder,
    projectScaffolder,
    codeWriter,
    patternMatcher,
    validator,
    deployer,
  },
  memory: enhancedMemory, // With pattern extraction
});
```

## Appendix A: Example Interaction

```
User: I need an agent that can help with customer support tickets

Agent Builder: I'll help you create a customer support agent. Let me understand your requirements:

1. What channels will it handle? (email, chat, both?)
2. Does it need access to a knowledge base?
3. Should it escalate complex issues?
4. Any integrations needed? (CRM, ticketing system?)

User: It should handle email and chat, access our docs, and integrate with Zendesk

Agent Builder: Perfect! I'll create a customer support agent with:
- Multi-channel support (email/chat)
- Documentation access via RAG
- Zendesk integration for ticket management
- Escalation workflow for complex issues

Let me generate the initial configuration...
