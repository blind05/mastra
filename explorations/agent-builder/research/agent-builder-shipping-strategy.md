# Mastra Agent Builder: Incremental Shipping Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the incremental shipping strategy for the Mastra Agent Builder, from experimental release to full production integration.

## Shipping Phases

### Phase 1: Experimental Package

**Goal**: Validate core concept with early adopters

#### Package: `@mastra/agent-builder`

```json
{
  "name": "@mastra/agent-builder",
  "version": "0.1.0-experimental.1",
  "description": "AI-powered agent creation for Mastra (Experimental)",
  "keywords": ["mastra", "agent", "ai", "code-generation", "experimental"]
}
```

#### What Ships
- Core agent with basic tools
- Simple examples
- Basic documentation
- GitHub repository with issues enabled

#### Success Criteria
- âœ… Can create a basic working agent with conversation ability
- âœ… Can create custom tools with proper Zod schemas
- âœ… Can attach tools to agents
- âœ… Generated code passes TypeScript compilation
- âœ… Generated tests pass on first run

#### Communication
```markdown
## ðŸ§ª Experimental: Mastra Agent Builder

We're exploring AI-powered agent creation. This is very early - expect breaking changes!

```typescript
import { agentBuilder } from '@mastra/agent-builder';

const response = await agentBuilder.generate(
  "Create a customer support agent"
);
```

**We need your feedback!** Please share your experience in GitHub issues.
```

### Phase 2: CLI Integration

**Goal**: Improve developer experience with interactive tooling

#### What Ships
- `mastra agent-builder` CLI command
- Interactive and non-interactive modes
- Integration with existing Mastra CLI
- Improved templates and patterns

#### Changes from Phase 1
- More stable API (still beta)
- Better error messages
- Template system
- File generation capabilities

#### Success Criteria
- âœ… Can add memory (conversation/semantic) to existing agents
- âœ… Can search for and configure MCP servers
- âœ… Can create multi-step workflows
- âœ… Can modify existing agent code using AST transforms
- âœ… Interactive mode guides users to working agents
- âœ… Non-interactive mode works for automation/CI

#### Migration Guide
```markdown
## Agent Builder now in CLI!

The experimental package continues to work, but we recommend using the CLI:

```bash
# Interactive mode
$ mastra agent-builder

# Quick generation
$ mastra agent-builder "Create monitoring agent"
```

The package will remain available but won't receive new features.
```

### Phase 3: Playground Integration

- âœ… Can configure agent networks and communication
- âœ… Visual workflow builder for agent interactions
- âœ… Real-time testing of generated agents
- âœ… Can export complete working projects
- âœ… Template system with domain-specific agents

- âœ… Can generate monitoring and telemetry setup
- âœ… Generate tests with high coverage
- âœ… Template system with version control

### Phase 5: Ecosystem Integration (Ongoing)

**Goal**: Make agent builder the standard way to create Mastra agents

#### What Ships
- VS Code extension integration
- GitHub Copilot integration
- Community templates
- Educational content

## Version Management

### Experimental â†’ Beta â†’ Stable

```typescript
// Phase 1: Experimental
"@mastra/agent-builder": "0.1.0-experimental.1"

// Phase 2: Beta
"@mastra/agent-builder": "0.5.0-beta.1"

// Phase 3: Release Candidate
"@mastra/agent-builder": "1.0.0-rc.1"

// Phase 4: Stable
"@mastra/agent-builder": "1.0.0"
```

### Breaking Changes Policy

#### Experimental (0.x.x)
- Can break anything
- No migration guides
- Fast iteration

#### Beta (0.5.x - 0.9.x)
- Minimize breaking changes
- Provide migration guides
- Deprecation warnings

#### Stable (1.x.x)
- No breaking changes in minor versions
- Long deprecation cycles
- Migration tools provided

## Feature Rollout Strategy

### Progressive Feature Flags

```typescript
const features = {
  // Phase 1
  basicGeneration: true,
  templates: false,
  
  // Phase 2
  cliIntegration: true,
  advancedTemplates: true,
  
  // Phase 3
  visualBuilder: true,
  realTimePreview: true,
  
  // Phase 4

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Poor Generation Quality**
   - Mitigation: Extensive testing, template fallbacks
   - Metric: Track success rate per phase

2. **Performance Issues**
   - Mitigation: Cache patterns, optimize transforms
   - Metric: Generation time P95 < 30s

3. **Breaking Changes**
   - Mitigation: Clear versioning, migration tools
   - Metric: < 5% users report breaking issues

### User Experience Risks
